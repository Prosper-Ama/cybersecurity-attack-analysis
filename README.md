# Cybersecurity Attack Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes historical cybersecurity incidents within Stark Industries, a global technology company. Using various data science tools and techniques, we explore attack patterns, trends, and potential vulnerabilities, ultimately providing insights to strengthen Stark Industries' defense strategies.

## Assumptions
Due to the absence of detailed requirements, the following assumptions were made:
- The dataset represents internal cybersecurity logs and attack data from Stark Industries' network infrastructure.
- Stark Industries employs standard cybersecurity defenses like firewalls and intrusion detection systems.
- The CEO, our target audience, has no background in cybersecurity, so findings and recommendations are presented in accessible, non-technical language.
- The dataset, collected from 2020 to 2023, accurately reflects the cybersecurity incidents faced by Stark Industries.
- That the threat actors behave rationally, aiming to maximize impact while minimizing risk.

## Requirements & Objectives
1. **Understand Trends**: Identify peak periods of attacks to inform future risk mitigation strategies.
2. **Analyze Severity Distribution**: Assess the severity levels to prioritize resources and response efforts.
3. **Examine Attack Types**: Highlight common attack types and their frequency to refine defensive measures.
4. **Assess Response Actions**: Review existing actions (e.g., ignored, blocked) and propose improvements.
5. **Correlation Analysis**: Explore relationships between severity, anomaly scores, and attack types.

## Tools and Libraries
- **Python (Pandas, Numpy)**: For data manipulation and statistical analysis.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For creating visual representations of trends, severity levels, and attack distributions.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Centralized platform to integrate code, visualizations, and documentation for streamlined analysis.

## Key Findings
- **Attack Trend Over Time**: Attack spikes were observed in Q1(March) each year, with high activity in March 2023 and July 2022.
- **Severity Levels**: Medium-severity attacks were the most frequent, highlighting a potential gap in security response.
- **Attack Types**: Distributed Denial of Servic(DDoS) attacks were the most common, followed by malware infections and intrusions.
- **Action Taken**: A significant number of attacks were ignored, suggesting that a proactive response strategy is needed.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Minimal relationships were found between severity, attack type, and anomaly scores.

## Recommendations
1. **Proactive Q1 Security Measures** increase security monitoring and vulnerability assessments during the first quarter of each year. This timing aligns with the release of new software and hardware, which often introduces exploitable vulnerabilities. 
2. **Proactive Measures**: Increase monitoring and responses to medium-severity attacks, as they frequently occur and can disrupt operations.
3. **Review Ignored Actions**: Redefine criteria for ignoring attacks, ensuring no harmful attacks go unaddressed.
4. **Targeted Defenses**: Prioritize defenses against DDoS attacks and other frequent attack types, using insights from the attack frequency distribution.
5. **Regular Training**: Educate non-technical executives on key cybersecurity metrics to improve understanding and support for cybersecurity initiatives.
